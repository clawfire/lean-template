## Style

### Buttons as links

You can add the classes `ui button` to any link in your editor to get a button style. See [more styling options](http://semantic-ui.com/elements/button.html) for the buttons.

## Shortcodes

### Icon

You can use [all the icons provides by Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/elements/icon.html) with this tag :

`[icon color="red" icon="heart" size="medium"]`

You wil get a red medium sized heart icon. See the [size](http://semantic-ui.com/elements/icon.html#size), [color](http://semantic-ui.com/elements/icon.html#colored) attributes

### Buttons

You can create [button links as made in Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/elements/button.html) with this shortcut syntax :

`[button href="http://google.com" title="Discover our service" color="blue" size="medium"]See more[/button]`

[Size](http://semantic-ui.com/elements/button.html#size) and [color](http://semantic-ui.com/elements/button.html#colored) can be customized.

### Grid

#### Create a new row

Row can contain two or more columns and column will adjust at equal width:

`[row]content here event other shortcode[/row]`

#### Create a new column

`[column]content event shortcode[/column]`

#### Example of a 3 column grid

Be carefull, as we know, WordPress add automaticly `<p></p>` tags at any new line. To prevent any misrendering, carefully use the shortcodes.

[row][column]Professor, make a woman out of me. A true inspiration for the children. There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?

[button href="http://google.com" title="Discover our service" color="blue" size="medium"]See more[/button][/column][column]And then the battle's not so bad? You guys go on without me! I'm going to goâ€¦ look for more stuff to steal! These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.

[button href="http://google.com" title="Discover our service" color="blue" size="medium"]See more[/button][/column][column]Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.
